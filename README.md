# Samosville

2D Strategy Board Game made with Java. Collect resources, to Create Workes, to Collect more resources, to Create Warrior to fight for your castle. It was initially started as a project for my University's assignment and now it's available for everybuddy.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have installed the latest version of Java

### Installing

Here's the link to download the game and play it without the source code: https://www.dropbox.com/s/04yhacog4h1957b/Samosville.zip?dl=0

However, to make changes to the code you have to install the source code.

Install the repository(master) and open it with IDE of your choice (Mine was eClipse)

You will need to connect the libraries to the bulding path. Once inside the IDE right-click the project -> Properties -> Java Build Path
-> Libraries -> Add External JARs. Now the jars are located in the folder Libs inside the project you installed, select all the jars in the Libs/jars folder and add them. Then click on the lwjgl.jar and add the Native folder, which is Libs/native/windows (assuming you're running it on Windows). Done!
